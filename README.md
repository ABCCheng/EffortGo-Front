## About
EffortGo is a personal project, based on open-source projects from Github. It brings together tools commonly used across various industries in daily life and work. If you find EffortGo helpful, you can add it to your favorites, export it as a desktop application through your browser, or share it with your friends.

EffortGo will remain free and open-source. If you would like to support my work and encourage me to add more tools, you are welcome to contribute through the "Support Me" button.

## Technologies
EffortGoâ€™s front-end is developed using Vue3, TypeScript and the Naive UI component library.
