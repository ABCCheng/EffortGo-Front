    # About EffortGo

    EffortGo is a personal project developed by ABCCheng, based on open-source projects from Github. 
    It brings together tools commonly used across various industries in daily life and work. 
    If you find EffortGo helpful, you can add it to your favorites, export it as a desktop application through your browser, 
    or share it with your friends.  
    
    EffortGo will remain free and open-source. 
    In the future, ads may be introduced to sustain operations. 
    If you would like to support my work and encourage me to add more tools, 
    you are welcome to contribute through the <span style="color: #FF7F50; font-weight: bold;">Support Me</span> button.

    ## Technologies
